This project is not yet finished, so some features are not yet supported. For more information, please see [the 1.0 release milestone](https://github.com/r-thomson/SwiftySass/milestone/1).

## Installation

First, you need to have LibSass installed on your system. SwifySass expects the installation to be located at `/usr/local/include/`. Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is suggested:

```sh
brew install libsass
```

SwiftySass can be installed using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). To use SwiftySass in a project, add it to the `dependencies` section in your projectâ€™s `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/r-thomson/SwiftySass", from: "0.3.0")
```

## Usage

```swift
import SwiftySass

// Compile from a string...
let scss = """
$primary-color: #222;
body {
  color: $primary-color;
}
"""
var css = try? compileSass(fromSource: scss)

// ...or from a file
let fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "./style.scss")
css = try? compileSass(fromFile: fileURL)
```
